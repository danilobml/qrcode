## Overview
My solution to the challenge. I'm a complete beginner to HTML, CSS, and coding in general. I'd really appreciate your inputs and constructive criticism.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did this as an attempt to apply my still pretty poor knowledge of HTML and CSS. I've just started learning to code, for less than a month at this point.

What I did is based on examples and ideas I've learned from my classes at the WBS Coding School Berlin.

Pretty much everything is a new thing I'm learning :)

Examples: learning how to use the external font-family (Outfit).

*Applying media queries - This is still difficult for me and I'm still uncertain if what I did is correct (maybe someone could give me a feedback)...

### Continued development

CSS flexbox positioning, especially responsive, is still pretty hard for me. I need to do many more exercises and projects like this.

### Useful resources

- [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand how to link to an external font-family.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - They have tips to solve a lot of coding problems. It was especially useful for positioning with flexbox.
