## Overview
My solution to the challenge. I'm a complete beginner to HTML, CSS, and coding in general. I'd really appreciate your inputs and constructive criticism. 

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did this as an attempt to apply my still pretty poor knowledge of HTML and CSS. I've just started learning to code (for less than a month at this point).

A lot of what I did is based on examples and ideas I've learned from my classes at the WBS Coding School Berlin.

Pretty much everything is a new thing I'm learning :)

Examples: learning how to use the external font-family (Outfit).

Applying media queries.

### Continued development

CSS flexbox positioning it's still pretty hard for me. I need to do many more exercises and projects like this.

### Useful resources

- [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand how to link to an external font-family.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - They have tips to solve a lot of coding problems. It was especially useful for positioning with flexbox.
